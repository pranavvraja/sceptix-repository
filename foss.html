          <P>"Free and open Source software." it refers to software that is distributed with its source code available
            for anyone to view,modify,and distribute. This allows
            users to study how the software works, make changes to it, and share their changes with others.

    <h2 style="font-size: 50px; position: relative; "> Benefits Over Proprietary Software </h2>
    <br>
    <h6 id="sub">1.COST-</h6>
    <p id="text"> FOSS is often available at no cost or at a much lower cost that
      proprietary software. This can be especially
      important for individals, small businesses, or organizations with limited budgets.</p>

    <br>
    <h4 id="sub">2.FLEXIBILITY-</h4>

    <p id="text">FOSS allows user to customize the software to their needs and
      modify the code to suit their specific requirements.
      This is in contrast to proprietary software, which is often closed-source and may not allow for customisation.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 id="sub">3.SECURITY- </h4>
    <p id="text">FOSS is often more secure than proprietary software because its
      source code is available for
      inspection by anyone, allowing security vulnerabilities to be identified and addressed quickly. In contrast,
      proprietary software often relies on security through obscurity, which can be less effective.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 id="sub" >4.COMMUNITY-</h4>
    <p id="text">FOSS projects are often developed by a community of contributors
      who share knowledge
      and work collaboratively to improve the software. This can lead to a greater sense of community and more
      rapid development of new features.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 id="sub"> 5.COMPATIBILITY-</h4>
    <p id="text">FOSS often promotes standards-based interoperability, which means
      that it can
      work wellwith other software and systems. This can be especially important in complex computing environments.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 id="sub">6.LONGEVITY-</h4>
    <p id="text" >FOSS software is often built to last, and projects may be
      maintained for many years
      or even decades.This means that users can be assured that the software will continue to be available and supported
      in the long term.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 id="sub">7.ETHICS- </h4>
    <p id="text" >FOSS is often built on the principles of freedom, sharing, and
      community, which can be
      appealing to userswho value these ideals.</p>
