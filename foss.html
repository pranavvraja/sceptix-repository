        <P>"Free and open Source software." it refers to software that is distributed with its source code available
          for anyone to view,modify,and distribute. This allows
          users to study how the software works, make changes to it, and share their changes with others.

      <h2 class="title1"> Benefits Over Proprietary Software </h2>
      <br>
      <h3 id="benefit-head">1.COST-</h3>
      <p id='benefit-content'> FOSS is often available at no cost or at a much lower cost that
        proprietary software. This can be especially
        important for individals, small businesses, or organizations with limited budgets.</p>

      <br>
      <h3 id="benefit-head">2.FLEXIBILITY-</h3>

      <p id='benefit-content'>FOSS allows user to customize the software to their needs and
        modify the code to suit their specific requirements.
        This is in contrast to proprietary software, which is often closed-source and may not allow for customisation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="benefit-head">3.SECURITY- </h3>
      <p id='benefit-content'>FOSS is often more secure than proprietary software because its
        source code is available for
        inspection by anyone, allowing security vulnerabilities to be identified and addressed quickly. In contrast,
        proprietary software often relies on security through obscurity, which can be less effective.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="benefit-head">4.COMMUNITY-</h3>
      <p id='benefit-content'>FOSS projects are often developed by a community of contributors
        who share knowledge
        and work collaboratively to improve the software. This can lead to a greater sense of community and more
        rapid development of new features.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="benefit-head"> 5.COMPATIBILITY-</h3>
      <p id='benefit-content'>FOSS often promotes standards-based interoperability, which means
        that it can
        work wellwith other software and systems. This can be especially important in complex computing environments.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="benefit-head">6.LONGEVITY-</h3>
      <p id='benefit-content'>FOSS software is often built to last, and projects may be
        maintained for many years
        or even decades.This means that users can be assured that the software will continue to be available and
        supported
        in the long term.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="benefit-head">7.ETHICS- </h3>
      <p id='benefit-content'>FOSS is often built on the principles of freedom, sharing, and
        community, which can be
        appealing to userswho value these ideals.</p>

      <h2 class="title1">HISTORY</h2>
      <p id="history">
        >The development of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) has its roots in the early days of computing in the
        <mark>1950s</mark>and
        <mark>1960s.</mark>
        During this time, software was often distributed as <mark>source code</mark>, which allowed users to study and
        modify the code to suit their needs.
        <br>
        <br>
        >In the 1970s and 1980s, the development of proprietary software became <mark>more common</mark>, as companies
        began to develop
        and sell software for profit. However, a few notable exceptions remained, such as the UNIX operating system and
        the Emacs text
        editor, which were both developed as open-source projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        >The modern FOSS movement began to take shape in the 1980s, with the creation of the Free Software Foundation
        (FSF) by
        <mark>Richard Stallman</mark>in 1985. Stallman believed that software should be freely available for use,
        modification,
        and distribution, and he developed the GNU operating system and the GNU Public License (GPL) to promote this
        philosophy.
        <br>
        <br>
        >In the 1990s, the rise of the Internet and <mark>the World Wide Web </mark>led to a significant increase in the
        availability and
        popularity of FOSS. <mark>The Linux operating system,</mark> which was developed as an open-source project in
        the early 1990s,
        became increasingly popular, and many other FOSS projects began to emerge.
        <br>
        <br>
        >In the early 2000s, the term "Open Source" began to be used as an alternative to "Free Software," with the
        <mark>Open Source Initiative (OSI)</mark>being established in 1998 to promote the benefits of open-source
        software development.
        <br>
        <br>
        >Today, FOSS is widely used and has become an important part of the software industry. Many large companies,
        including
        <mark>IBM, Google, </mark>and <mark>Microsoft</mark>, have embraced FOSS and contribute to open-source projects.
        FOSS has also become an important tool for governments, non-profit organizations, and other groups that require
        cost-effective
        and flexible software solutions.

      <p>Ties with GNU/Linux</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mark1">

      <p>Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) is closely tied to the GNU/Linux operating system.
        Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel that was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.
        The kernel is a critical component of the operating system that provides <mark>low-level system services</mark>
        such as hardware <mark>device management</mark>, <mark>process management</mark>,and <mark>memory
          management.</mark>
        <br>
        <br>
        In the early days of Linux, the operating system lacked many of the user-level tools and applications that are
        necessary
        for a complete computing environment. This is where the <mark>GNU Project </mark>comes in. The GNU Project was
        founded by
        Richard Stallman in 1983 with the goal of creating a complete, free, and open-source Unix-like operating system.
        The GNU
        Project provided many of the tools and applications that are necessary for a complete computing environment,
        such as the
        <mark>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</mark>,<mark>the GNU C Library (glibc)</mark>, and <mark>the bash
          shell.</mark>
        <br>
        <br>
        When combined with the Linux kernel, these GNU tools and applications form a complete, free, and open-source
        operating system
        that is commonly known as GNU/Linux. The combination of the Linux kernel and the GNU tools and applications is
        often referred
        to as the <mark>GNU/Linux operating system.</mark>
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, GNU/Linux is a popular operating system that is widely used in a range of applications, including
        <mark>web servers,</mark>
        <mark> supercomputers,</mark>and <mark>embedded devices. </mark>The close tie between GNU and Linux has helped
        to promote the
        development of FOSS, and has led to the creation of a large and vibrant community of developers and users who
        <mark>work together to create and maintain high-quality, free, and pen-source software.</mark>
