<h2> Benefits over proprietary software </h2>
<p>1.COST-
              FOSS is often available at no cost or at a much lower cost that proprietary software. This can be especially 
              important for individals, small businesses, or organizations with limited budgets.
<br>
2.FLEXIBILITY-
FOSS allows user to customize the software to their needs and modify the code to suit their specific requirements.
This is in contrast to proprietary software, which is often closed-source and may not allow for customisation.
<br>
3.SECURITY- 
FOSS is often more secure than proprietary software because its source code is available for 
inspection by anyone, allowing security vulnerabilities to be identified and addressed quickly. In contrast, 
proprietary software often relies on security through obscurity, which can be less effective.
<br>
4.COMMUNITY- FOSS projects are often developed by a community of contributors who share knowledge
 and work collaboratively to improve the software. This can lead to a greater sense of community and more 
rapid development of new features.
<br>
5.COMPATIBILITY- FOSS often promotes standards-based interoperability, which means that it can work well
with other software and systems. This can be especially important in complex computing environments.
<br>
6.LONGEVITY- FOSS software is often built to last, and projects may be maintained for many years or even decades.
 This means that users can be assured that the software will continue to be available and supported in the long term.
<br>
7.ETHICS- FOSS is often built on the principles of freedom, sharing, and community, which can be appealing to users
 who value these ideals.
